<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Hi there! I'm glad to hear about the bot made by Gry KJ, which seems to be an evolved version of Eva bot. As for how much better this version is compared to the first, it would depend on various factors such as improvements in natural language processing, better understanding of context, enhanced responses, expanded knowledge base, and possibly more engaging interactions. Without specific details about the enhancements, it's challenging to quantify precisely how much better this version might be, but I'm sure Gry KJ has put in a lot of effort to make significant improvements!</span>
